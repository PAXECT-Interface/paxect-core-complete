# PAXECT Enterprise Pack Overview — Core Complete

Welcome!  
This document outlines the **Enterprise Pack vision** for the **PAXECT Core Complete** ecosystem —  
the verified, multi-module runtime that unifies **Core**, **AEAD Hybrid**, **Polyglot**, **SelfTune**, and **Link** into one deterministic, auditable platform.

---

## Scope

The **open-source foundation** remains permanently free under the Apache-2.0 license:

- `paxect-core` (deterministic runtime)  
- `paxect-aead-hybrid-plugin` (secure AEAD hybrid bridge)  
- `paxect-polyglot-plugin` (cross-language data pipelines)  
- `paxect-selftune-plugin` (adaptive runtime control)  
- `paxect-link-plugin` (relay + inbox/outbox policy layer)  
- Demo suite (01–15) and continuous CI validation  

The **Enterprise Pack** introduces optional capabilities for regulated industries and large-scale adopters —  
focusing on reliability, compliance, and observability at production scale.

---

## Vision

The Enterprise Pack is designed to **extend** PAXECT, not replace it.  
Its purpose is to enhance large-scale deployment and integration.

**Key enterprise capabilities include:**

- 🔐 **Advanced Security Integrations:** HSM / KMS / Vault connectors  
- 🧾 **Audit & Policy Engine:** detailed runtime logs and compliance mappings  
- 📈 **Monitoring Connectors:** Prometheus, Grafana, Splunk, Kafka  
- ⚙️ **Deployment Assets:** Helm charts, Docker images, systemd service templates  
- 🧩 **Compliance Frameworks:** ISO / IEC / NIST mappings and audit templates  
- 💠 **Priority Support:** via verified enterprise partners or PAXECT maintainers

---

## Community & Ownership

- The **Core** and all open-source modules remain free and transparent.  
- The **Enterprise Pack** is a **proprietary extension**, maintained by the PAXECT Owner.  
- Future co-maintainers and enterprise partners may contribute through private repositories.  
- No vendor lock-in: all enterprise tooling builds on open, documented APIs.  

> **Core stays free. Enterprise stays open to integrate.**

---

## Participation

At this stage:
- The Enterprise Pack is **not yet publicly distributed**.  
- Volunteers and early partners are **welcome to help define** its scope.  
- Integration tests and compliance validation are currently being piloted.

## Key Principle

> **Open Core. Verified Extensions. Zero Telemetry.**

**PAXECT Core Complete** provides a reproducible, privacy-first foundation  
for both community users and enterprises — deterministic, measurable, and fully auditable.
