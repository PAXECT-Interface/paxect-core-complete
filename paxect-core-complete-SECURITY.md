# Security Policy — PAXECT Core Complete

Security is a first-class principle of the **PAXECT Core Complete** ecosystem.  
All modules — **Core**, **AEAD Hybrid**, **Polyglot**, **SelfTune**, and **Link** — are developed with deterministic design, zero telemetry, and full reproducibility in mind.

Older versions are provided *as-is* without any maintenance or guarantee.
